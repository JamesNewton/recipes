Colcannon

Serves: A hungry family.

Ingredients:
- Enough Potatoes to fill your largest pot
- As much bacon as your heart can stand
- Some scalions or green onions
- A stick (or more) of butter. NOT the fake stuff.
- Salt

Directions:
Wash the potatoes, but don't peel them. If they are very large, cut into pieces about 2 to 3 inches square. Put them on to boil with a lid.

While the potatoes are cooking, start a pan or two (or three) of bacon. You want the bacon crisp and brittle. 

While the bacon is cooking, wash and tear the cabbage into chunks as if making a salad, and chop up the scalions or small onions.

Once the bacon is finished, dump the cabbage into the water with the potatoes and the onions into the bacon grease and turn off the heat on the bacon.

Continue cooking the cabbage until it's just right; not too crunchy, not too withered. 

Drain the potatoes and cabbage with a colander and dump back into the pot. Add butter, onions and bacon grease, and bacon. Stir until your arm hurts. Serve with salt.
